# Bumper

Bumper brings together car owner and service provider. Car serivce provider (like mechanics or washing services etc.) can create and share their services which then can be booked by car owner. 

For services provider Bumper works like a CRM tool. They get nofitications about new appointments and can manged them in their dashboard.
Car owner on the other side are able to quickly book the car service they need.

At a later stage Bumper plans to integrate the smartcar API to work with real time car data.
With that live data car owner can manage their car's efficient. They will be informed about upcoming oil changes or other general car services.
