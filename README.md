# Bumper

Bumper connects car owners and service providers to provide convenient, on-demand car maintenance. Car service providers, such as mechanics or car wash facilities, can create and share their services which then can be booked by car owner. 

For service providers, Bumper works as a CRM tool. A provider gets nofitications about new appointments and can manage them in a user-friendly dashboard.
Car owners, on the other hand, are able to quickly book the car service they need.

At a later stage Bumper plans to integrate the Smartcar API to work with real-time car data.
With live data, a car owner can manage their car efficiently. They will be informed about upcoming oil changes or other general car services.
